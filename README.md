This Repo was meant for an Youtube tutorial I made a year ago

The code in here is free to use and is supposed to show how you can implement custom
shooting mechanics. I might remake the video in the future but for now its delisted

The code is free & open source no strings attached, no credits needed. I hope this can
guide you even if its only 1 step to your goal.

I added notes for those new to modding or that do not understand a specific line of code
